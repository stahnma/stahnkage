    Well, a couple things to report about for spacewalk.  First off, Nigel Jones and I put in a bug for spacewalk to get it into Fedora.  It can be found <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=452450" >452450</a>.  I also started a page tracking progress of the packages.  <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/GettingPackagesIntoFedora" >on the hosted wiki. </a>.  Looks like Nigel started a few packages, so hopefully this week we can finish with the perl packages and move on to the next set....java.  I'll need a lot of help here, so if you know anything about Java, speak up. <br />
<br />
Also, thanks to help from Justin, I think I have a patch ready for spacewalk that allows a user to list system notes via XML-RPC.  In his words "It's stupid easy." In my mind, I just saw difficult java, but at least I have an understanding of JavaDoc.  <img src="http://www.stahnkage.com/blogs/templates/GreenMile/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /><br />

    So, I didn't exactly blog about Friday yet, and now Saturday is pretty much gone too.  So, you get two, two, two days in one. <br />
<br />
Friday started with a conspicuously empty trek to the assembly hall.  They keynote<sup>H</sup>H<sup>H</sup>H<sup>H</sup>H^H err panel, was not very well attended.  I think many people decided to duck out on Friday.  I went to straight up to FUDcon and starting working on a few things.  I don't remember exactly what, but I think that's when I put up yesterday's post.  <br />
<br />
After a few people pitching talks/discussion/hackfests about Spins, or NightLife or other things, we decided to have a small Spacewalk hackfest.  I'll call it a hack-fest, but it was more like an installfest, and a not very good one at that <img src="http://www.stahnkage.com/blogs/templates/GreenMile/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" />  Spacewalk of course is brand new the Open Source world and still has a few issues, at least for my use cases.  I was trying to install on F9, which theoretically should work, but in practice doesn't yet; at least not in any method I was using.  I found some odd dependency issues, and starting documenting them.  I realized that osad had a binary rpm, but no source rpm and decided this was going to be problematic in the long run.  <img src="http://www.stahnkage.com/blogs/templates/GreenMile/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" />  <br />
<br />
After a couple hours of Spacewalk discussion and roadmapping (less technical but equally as important), we switched to an EPEL community meeting.  This was equally as exciting and took about 2 hours.  Wow.  It was long.  We had some really serious discussion about RHX and 3rd party contributors from open source companies.  That led to much discussion on Java.  Systems Admins don't like or really understand Java.  This was a conclusion I came to at least 4 years ago and think it is still true today. Either way, the discussion was great.  We covered some serious ground and had some good discussion. I think we agreed to a new community meeting time also.  Watch the EPEL list for more details.  <br />
<br />
Saturday was BarCamp day.  It was my first experience at a decent-sized barcamp and was awesome. I began a first pass at the spacewalk<a href="https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/RepoCleanup"> yum issues</a>during some of the talks. <br />
<br />
 I attended a talk on Community Standard (or Service) Infrastructure that Mike McGrath is heading.  It's amazingly close to a theory/paradigm I had been working on, called "the infrastructure maturity model," so I am hoping we can converge them.  It will have lots to do with standards, tools and processes for a good infrastructure based around open ideas.  I love the concept and hopefully now I can help make it a reality.  <br />
<br />
The second talk was on git.  Git still confuses me.  I probably just need to work with it to really get it.  I have used it only to download source and not really done much else with it.  <br />
<br />
The third talk (after lunch) was about Func.  It was so amazingly similar to a tool we wrote in house, it was scary.  It's way more scalable, and pretty cool.  I'll be checking it out soon.  I need to see if I could possibly have it work on AIX/Solaris/HPUX.  <img src="http://www.stahnkage.com/blogs/templates/GreenMile/img/emoticons/sad.png" alt=":-(" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /><br />
<br />
The next talk was "Care and Feeding for SIGs"  Rex and I talked about SIGs for a while, specifically EPEL and KDE.  Then he helped with a Kflickr bug <img src="http://www.stahnkage.com/blogs/templates/GreenMile/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /><br />
<br />
Finally, it was Cobbler.  I met Michael Dehaan this week and got to talk with him quite a lot. His func and cobbler tools are quite nice for the sys-admin.  <br />
He hand-installed a cobbler server on this very laptop.  He also uses cool words like Voltronic-software (for pluggable-type software that can become a great thing when combined with other stuffs).  <br />
<br />
After the Fedora state of the Union (where several great people were recognized), we went to the Boston University Pub.  It was cool.  Got some Rogue Dead Guy and a few burgers.  We talked Fedora (I know, it's surprising) and I hacked a tiny bit on the actual Spacewalk source. I think I wrote my fisrt Java code in about 8 years, maybe 10.  <br />
<br />
So, FUDcon and RH Summit are over.  I didn't get very much on my todo list done, really, I got nothing on it done.  It was still amazing.  Thanks to everyone at Fedora.  It's quite awesome to be a part of something with great ideals.  I probably won't miss another North American FUDcon.  It was easily the best technical conference I have ever been to.  Thanks to Dennis Gilmore for inviting into the community two years ago. <br />

    Yesterday was an extremely busy day for me.  The day started at 7:30 with breakfast and manning the Fedora booth.  After the keynotes, I hit, the opening for FUDcon.  That was great and I got to meet some good people again.  Have I mentioned that FUDcon is super-cool for meeting good people who care about open source?  After that, I gave my talk on Managing Updates in the Enterprise.  I blogged about that a bit yesterday.  From there, FUDcon took full-swing for a bit.  I hacked on a couple things, talked with an ISV person about EPEL, and ran into a friend who moved to Boston recently from Nashville.  <br />
<br />
I attended the EPEL talk for a few minutes, regrettably, because the Spacewalk campground session was starting only 15 minutes after the EPEL talk. Since, I figured I knew a lot about EPEL and plenty of knowledgeable people were in attendance, I ducked out to hit the spacecamp session.  A few good questions were asked during the campground talk, and it was well attended.  The downside was that it was REALLY difficult to hear questions and/or answers.  <br />
<br />
Shot back up the stairs to here Jim Whitehurst speech at FUDcon.  He took questions for about an hour. It was neat to see how interactive the session was.  <br />
<br />
Then, up to the 52nd floor of the Prudential building for the spacewalk/FreeIPA launch party. I spoke with several of the Satellite engineering team, and the product managers and security managers and I think a couple vice-presidents.  It was pretty cool.  I got to talk a lot about $DAYJOB, and what problems/issues we face and where we could head. <br />
<br />
Once that died down, it was down to the 50th floor for the night-event.  It was pretty neat.  The view on both floors was awesome.  The 50th floor had some good foodstuffs and open bar.  After that, with a few guys, we went to the Pubichouse.  (I think that was how it was spelled).  It was rated an A+ world-class beer establishment from Beer Advocate.  It was.  I got an Orval, (From Belgium) and it was great. I also got a DeadGuy, because I hadn't had one in quite a while.<br />
<br />
We rolled back into the Hotel around 1:45 AM.  I got up at8:00 AM, and am now at FUDcon.  Let's hack!<br />
<br />
<br />
So my todo list for the rest of FUDcon is supposed to be about 7 things, but I can only think of 6 of them right now. <br />
1.  Get a bug fixed in spacewalk with Justin.  I'll learn a little and have a problem solved.<br />
2.  Attend a git talk to learn about what I suck at.<br />
3.  Create EPEL logo with Mizmo<br />
4.  Get Perl-Frontier-RPC into EPEL<br />
5.  Review the OBM review request for Fedora<br />
6.  Get Spacewalk on my Laptop <br />

    I couldn't be more excited about this new offering from the Open Source community and Red Hat.  <A href="http://www.redhat.com/spacewalk/">Spacewalk</a> is the name.  It will be the new upstream for RHN Satellite.  In other words, <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/147258/red_hat_network_to_be_opensourced.html">RHN Satellite is finally open</a>.  I have been complaining about it for years...literally years.  I just need to get this downloaded and start bug-fixing.  Last time I checked Bugzilla, there were over 400 bugs for Satellite, (before I filed a couple).  Now, I can start fixing them.  The downsides? <br />
1.  My presentation for Thursday was written before RHN Satellite was open sourced.  This means, it's now slightly out-dated. Oh well, I can ad-lib and welcome my new open management overlords. <br />
2.  It's written in at least 3 languages and one is Java.  Wow, do I suck at Java? Yes.  Do I normally rip on Java? Absolutely.  <br />
3.  It's time to really learn git.  I am hoping FUDcon will have an intro on it, because I really haven't used it other than a checkout.  <br />
<br />
<br />
So while this hasn't officially been announced yet at the RH Summit, the RHN-satellite-users mailing list had a post on it, and of course the Spacewalk website is up.    They also publicized it in the RH Free Press (the Summit daily newspaper).  Also, you can check out #spacewalk on Freenode, the fedorahosted site, and ask around in person if you're at the FUDcon/summit.  <br />
<br />
Again, I am so excited.   My business unit will probably have spacewalk sometime next week when I get back.  My home infrastructure will have it up before that.  I can't wait. <br />

    Well, the main part of day 1 is over.  The Fedora booth was busy again today, and continues to be in full-swing.  We keep running out of CD/DVDs to supply, but that's ok, I guess that means it's popular.  I am kind of surprised that the Fedora CDs are going over this well.  I would think that if you were attending a Red Hat Summit, you would already be running, or at least be familiar with Fedora.  Oh well, spreading the word is good.<br />
<br />
I attended sessions in every slot; I wasn't sure I would.  First thing in the morning I attended the Keynotes.  They were pretty good, but nothing too shocking announced, which kind of sucked.  The second speaker from Harvard Medical was great.  His topics were relative to nearly anybody in the US, as they were about healtcare.  It was quite cool to see something as large as government and health care demanding open standards and using them to share and protect patient information. While normally biology and healthcare are not my thing, this kept my attention.<br />
<br />
The first session I attended was an Eclipse demo from Andrew.  It was simailar to the one I saw in Nashville 2 years ago, but Eclipse has hada lot of new features since then.  While I am not a full-time developer, or even close to one, I enjoy Eclipse and wish I knew more about it. I would like to find a book or howto on using Eclipse, mostly from an end-user perspective and not telling me how to write Java.  Either way,it was a good talk and I enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
The second talk was Yingbull talking about RHN Satellite at his company.  His network, in some ways, is quite similar to my $DAYJOB environment, but his usage of Satellite was VERY different.  He used the configuration channels and kickstart features, which we don't, because we found them to be too restrictive.  His use cases were screaming Puppet or CFengine to me, but that's ok, he was rolling.  The different perspectives and use cases certainly make for good thought experiments. He was also using Proxies all over the place and we are not. We own a couple entitlements of it, but haven't used it yet.  Oh well..more on that another time.   I would like to talk to Yingbull a bit more on his setup and general systems management.<br />
<br />
Lunch was with a few #rhel people and was decent. The hall was crowded so we retreated to the speaker room.  It was quiet and all in all, rather empty.  w00t!.<br />
<br />
The third session was FreeIPA.  I didn't know a ton about FreeIPA when I went in, and I still feel like I don't.  I feel like I know they have lots of work to do, and the next version will have lots of things I would like.  It felt like a regular sales pitch.  "In the next version, we'll solve your problems."  I have kicked out many vendors for talks like that.  I want to know what things can do now.  It was more of a marketing pitch than a developer forum, and that's probably why it rubbed me the wrong way.  FreeIPA certainly seems promising, I will see if I can get a more technical dive later.<br />
<br />
<br />
Forth session was Fedora Directory Update.  I didn't realize how much keeping up with Dennis Gilmore means you keep up with Fedora Directory. I didn't learn a whole lot, but I did learn about a few of the new features that had made it into the directory.  Sadly, I didn't know some of them were not in there already.  <img src="http://www.stahnkage.com/blogs/templates/GreenMile/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" />  Not a lot of new material here.  Yes  the directory is now FHS compliant (thank all that is holy).<br />
<br />
The last formal session of the day was a Satellite demo of Virtualization and Multi-Org features.  My $DAYJOB runs Satellite 4.2.1 still, so this was a good chance to see some of the features of Satellite 5.1.  There were a couple of decent questions during the presentation.  There is apparently a multi-org white paper (that I have been pointed to before) that I really need to check out.  There is a hands-on demo tomorrow,so I'll see if I can check that out.<br />
<br />
After the last talk, I'll head back to the Fedora booth, say hi to a few more people and introduce myself to a few more people.<br />
<br />
As a final note for anybody planning the summit:  When you list a talk, define the audience. The little pamphlet doesn't show me if it's a product manager speaking, or a developer.  That's important to me.  I want to know if it's a dog &amp; pony show or actual content.

    Last night, the Fedora crew arrived.  I got to meet several people I only knew through IRC, as this is my first FUDcon.  I had met a few of the Fedora at the Summit in Nashville, but I wasn't involved in Fedora then.  So, we hung out at the Fedora booth.  Our primary function thus-far has been to put a live image on the Fedora USB key provided to registered people at the Summit.  It's kind of a shame that the USB keys didn't come pre-loaded, but that's ok.   The image we're loading up was fully patched as of Monday.  <br />
<br />
I also got to meet several people who hang out on #rhel, #rhn, and #rhn-satellite, and a couple people from #epel.  I also bugged mizmo about a <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Artwork/DesignService#EPEL">a logo for EPEL.</a>  Sounds like we'll try to white-board out some ideas once we connect with Smooge too.<br />
<br />
After the booth, we hit Uno's and ate.  Of course the Celtics won while on our walk home, but we survived.  <br />
<br />
Today, is day 1.  <br />
<br />
So far, we've had a decent breakfast. --> more to come later.

    Well, I am quite happy that Fedora has moved to Mediawiki as the wiki.  I thought when I originally suggested it (not that I was the only one by any means), it was shot down simply because it was written in PHP.  Then, one day, it was just decided.  (At least to me).  I was happy.  I've already edited the wiki more now than I ever did when it was in Moin.  I know Mediawiki syntax, it's used all over.  Moin was pretty much a one-off from my point of view.  So, now, we have a nice clean wiki with some really nice CSS files. <br />
<br />
Oh, and I signed up for Fedora planet. <br />
<br />
In other news, Ruby on Rails should be pushed to EPEL5 at the next push, which is the 15th of the month for EL5.  I thought they were in by then, but there might be a waiting period before pushing packages.  I think when/if we get to Bodhi, this will be easier to manage. <br />

I was happy.  I've already edited the wiki more now than I ever did when it was in Moin.  I know Mediawiki syntax, it's used all over.  Moin was pretty much a one-off from my point of view.  So, now, we have a nice clean wiki with some really nice CSS files. <br />
<br />
Oh, and I signed up for Fedora planet. <br />
<br />
In other news, Ruby on Rails should be pushed to EPEL5 at the next push, which is the 15th of the month for EL5.  I thought they were in by then, but there might be a waiting period before pushing packages.  I think when/if we get to Bodhi, this will be easier to manage. <br />

    When we moved to Nashville, we got internet, phone and tv from Comcast.  You've probably read my other blogs about how Comcastic == really crappy.  It still does, but I digress.  After our original 12 months of intro pricing expired, our cable bill shot up by 55$.  That sucks.  I called Comcast last week to see what I could do about it.  <br />

Their answer, well for 40$ less a month, you can have more digital channels and get Encore, MoviePlex and IFC.  I was like, wait, so less money and more channels?  They said yes.  It is sad they don't call me and let me know this ahead of time.  Instead they take my money and just fill it in their profit sack.  So, yeah, we have more channels now and I can finally watch VH1 classic again.  <img src="http://www.stahnkage.com/blogs/templates/GreenMile/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /><!-- s9ymdb:169 --><img width='81' height='110' style="float: right; border: 0px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;" src="http://www.stahnkage.com/blogs/uploads/rb.serendipityThumb.jpg" alt="" /><br />
<br />
So, yeah, this isn't by any means, a new movie, nor Oscar nominated.  Jaime and I were flipping through our new movie channels and Reality Bites showed up.   The last time I saw this movie, I think I was 16.  I bought the soundtrack before seeing the movie, because it had "Stay" from Lisa Loeb and "My Sharona" from the The Knack.  I still like the soundtrack.  <br />
<br />
When I saw the movie the first time, I thought it was one of those "talking movies" and lacked any real plot.  I appreciated it much more this time around.  The plot seemed more real and the movie was pretty decent.  There is a scene where Ben Stiller talks about how great "Frampton Comes Alive" is.  He points out how this album changed his life and all that.  Then, on the soundtrack, there is no Frampton.  There is Big Mountain covering "Baby I love your way."  That's a disappointment.  Apparently to get the licensing rights for Stay, they had to include the Big Mountain cover instead.  That sucks. <br />
<br />
All in the all, the movie is decent and certainly capture the 90s nicely.  I would give a B-.  <br />

    Continuing the Oscar-nominated movie watching theme, we also watched <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406/>Juno</a>.  I had this was a good movie from several sources and that the soundtrack was good.  This normally means good things for me.  If a movie has a good soundtrack, even if the film sucks, it at least saves it from being horrible.   <br />

When I sat down to watch this movie I had absolutely no idea what it was about.  I try to do that sometimes just to surprise myself.  Even reading the back of the dvd cover can give things away.  I enjoyed the opening sequence with Juno drinking tons of Sunny-D and kept enjoying the movie throughout. When I saw that Jason Bateman was in the film, Jaime and I were hoping that he would play a really big tool in his role.  He didn't so much, which was a minor disappointment, but still we somehow managed through.  <br />
<br />
Jason Bateman has become my favorite tool actor in recent years.  It probably started with Arrested Development and carried over into Dodge Ball, and Starsky and Hutch, and a few other roles, but I digress.<br />
<br />
So, Juno was awesome.  This movie had me intrigued throughout with witty dialogue and other funny moments.  <br />
<br />
This movie was shot in only 31 days according to IMDB, and it was awesome.  <br />
<br />
If you haven't seen it, I recommend it.  This is probably the best movie I have seen since <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0907657/>Once</a>.

    Jaime and I have been trying to watch many of the Oscar nominated films for this past year.  We've watched a couple already and honestly, I am a little behind on blogging.  That's ok, hopefully I can catch up today. <!-- s9ymdb:166 --><img width='72' height='110' style="float: left; border: 0px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;" src="http://www.stahnkage.com/blogs/uploads/blood.serendipityThumb.jpg" alt="" /><br />

The other night we sat down to watch <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/>There Will Be Blood</a>.  I had heard this was a pretty decent film from sources I knew nothing about, so obviously I had expectations set.  First off, it was kind of a Western. I am not normally a fan of Westerns, so it wasn't going to be awesomes.  <br />
<br />
As I was watching the movie, I found myself getting restless and really just not enjoying it.  I mean, the main character is a jerk, we get it.  The movie drug and on, and really could have been at least 45 minutes shorter.   The argument with the church and the town seemed forced as well.  All in all, I would rate this movie rather poorly and wouldn't watch it again.  How exactly it was nominated for an Oscar I am not sure.  Also, the title is somewhat misleading, I mean, there is some blood I guess, but it hardly summarized the plot or feeling throughout the movie.  The original book title was called "Oil" and that makes a whole lot more sense.  <br />
<br />
So yeah, it sucked.
