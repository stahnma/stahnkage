<br />
First off, they are built the same; both are big guys that you would imagine to be overbearing. But as the show progressed, he wasn?t your typical alpha male, and sometimes acted mostly like a woman. Over the season, we got to see Jose wear lip gloss (often), a banana hammock, and pink lace women?s underwear. The similarities are uncanny.<br />

<I>I actually gained respect for Canseco because of the show. Just like the season with Eric Estrada (who apparently is shooting a reality show in Muncie, according to my mom). </I>

    Everybody and their brother has an awards show, or a year-end wrap up, or whatever.  You know what, we fall into that category too.  I was convinced by Jason T Rutherford to have the first annual Stahnkees awards.  It's fun because I can come up the category, nominated whomever I choose, and then award them the honor of nothing.  I mean, what more could the internet ask for?  <br />
<br />
For example, the first Stahnkee ever given went to "The person I call most in California.' and that was Jason T. Rutherford.  It was close between him and technical support for several companies I work with, but Rutherford pulled it out by a hair.  Remember, though, it is an honor just to be nominated. <br />
<br />
So, the purpose of this blog entry is to come up with some good categories for awards.  <br />
<br />
So far, I have been thinking:<br />
<br />
Album of the year<br />
Best album I listened to for the first time this year<br />
Worst Artist of year<br />
Worst Internet Fiasco <br />
Best Purchase of the Year<br />
Worst Purchase of the Year<br />
Blog of the Year (on stahnkage)<br />
Quote of the year<br />
Open Source Goodies of the year<br />
<br />
